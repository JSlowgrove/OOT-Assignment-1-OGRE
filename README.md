"# This is my README"  
  
Created by Jamie Slowgrove.  
You can do what you want with the code in this project, however you must credit the author and add a link back to the git repository.  

Created using Ogre3D:

Helicopter Model used is from:

My first object orientated techniques assignment. It is written in C++ and uses the Ogre3D Graphics Engine.   
This required me to create a basic 3D helicopter game using the OGRE framework provided by my lecturer.  
We were given lab session tasks to show us how to work with the framework and then told to use this to finish the assignment.  

The .sdf file has been compressed into a .zip in order to meet the github repository size limit.
