My first object orientated techniques assignment. It is written in C++ and uses the Ogre3D Graphics Engine.   
This required me to create a basic 3D helicopter game using the OGRE framework provided by my lecturer.  
We were given lab session tasks to show us how to work with the framework and then told to use this to finish the assignment.
